    <h1>Easy Vegan Bagels</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This vegan bagel recipe is super simple and tastes just as delicious as non-vegan bagels. They have a weirdly lumpy shape to them, but you'll forget 
        all about that once you bite into one and realize how delicious they are. <br>
        <br>
        The boiling step is also optional, but I've found that it adds a yummy crunch to the outer shell of the bagel.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Tips for storage:</strong> These bagels will generally keep for a 5-7 days in a cool dry container like a bread box. You can freeze them if 
        you want to keep them longer. <br>
