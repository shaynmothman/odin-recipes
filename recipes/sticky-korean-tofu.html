    <h1>Sticky Korean Tofu</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This sweet, spicy, sticky, crunchy tofu inspired by Korean flavors is to die for. It's got a crazy depth of both flavors and textures that will make it
        an instant favorite. I recommend serving it with white rice and broccoli, but you do you, boo.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>A note about spice:</strong> If you're like me and you have a partner who can't stand a ton of heat, this is <em>not</em> the recipe to try with them.
        The heat in this recipe comes from the gochujang, which means it's not a "front of the mouth kind of spice. It's the kind that sneaks up on you and makes
        you break into cold sweats if you eat too much of it. Probably a 3/5 in terms of spice, but you won't know you've gone too far until it's too late.
