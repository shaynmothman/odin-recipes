    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This Thai-style yellow curry is quick and easy comfort food that you can easily reheat throughout the week. You can choose to add spice
        to make it hotter if you wish. The only thing is that for some reason it can be difficult to find curry paste outside of Asian grocery stores.
        I had to order mine on Amazon!<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Tips:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>You can swap out the chicken and fish sauce to make a vegan version</li>
            <li>I hate crispy onions, so I caramelize my onions first; if this doesn't matter to you, add the onions with the carrots instead</li>
            <li>The original recipe called for 4 lime leaves but who knows where the hell to find those, so I omitted them</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4-5 chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized chunks or thin strips as you prefer</li>
        <li>3 large potatoes (or 5 small ones)</li>
        <li>1 medium-sized onion</li>
        <li>1 large carrot (don't eat baby carrots; they're an abomination)</li>
        <li>1 can unsweetened full-fat coconut milk</li>
        <li>2-3 Tbsp Thai yellow curry paste (Mae Ploy brand is the bomb diggity)</li>
        <li>1 tsp curry powder</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp fish sauce</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp lime juice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>On the Instant Pot, press the "Saute" button to heat up the pan</li>
        <li>Add 2 Tbsp of vegetable oil to the pan and fry the onions <em>forever</em> (you'll know they're done when they barely resemble onions, but instead
        look like a bunch of brown steaming clear strips of miscellaneous detritus)</li>
        <li>Add coconut milk and curry paste, stir and let simmer for approx. 1min</li>
        <li>Add curry powder and stir until bubbly</li>
        <li>Press "Cancel" to turn off saute function</li>
        <li>Add chicken and potatoes to the pot</li>
        <li>Close and seal the lid, turn on manual pressure cook (high pressure) for 3 minutes</li>
        <li>Do a Quick Release (QR) of pressure and open the Instant Pot</li>
        <li>Stir in fish sauce, sugar, lime juice, carrots, and lime leaves</li>
        <li>Turn on "Saute" again and cook until the veggies are crisp-tender (3-5minutes)</li>
        <li>Serve with rice</li>
    </ol>
