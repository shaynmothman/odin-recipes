# odin-recipes

Objective:
In this project, I will create a basic web page displaying a list of recipes.

Purpose:
This project is meant to demonstrate my ability to code a web page using HTML5, to use both relative links (in linking to other pages within the 
directory) and absolute links (in my use of images from external sources on the internet). It will also demonstrate my ability to format text using HTML,
to publish repos on GitHub, and to manage file and folder systems. I guess, theoretically, this project will also demonstrate my ability to cook some
bomb-ass food.

Metrics:
- Each recipe will be housed on its own page within the root directory.
- The main page will link to each recipe page.
- Each recipe page will include formatted text and images.
